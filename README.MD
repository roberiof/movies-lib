## ‚òï More about 
The project is a Movie Consulter, with it the user can see the best evaluated movies and  its information. Besides that, he can search for a movie and see its evaluation. In order to build it, I used the **[ TMDB API ](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/apil)**. It's made of 3 pages: Home, Search and Movie.
<br>
The job was made with help of Matheus Battisti on YouTube. I implemented some changes like adding a footer, using SCSS to ease code maintenance, validating user actions and using libraries (AOS  and Numeral.js).
